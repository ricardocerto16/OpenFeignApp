# Feign App Example


## How does Feign work?
Feign works by processing annotations into a templatized request. Arguments are applied to these templates in a straightforward fashion before output. Although Feign is limited to supporting text-based APIs, it dramatically simplifies system aspects such as replaying requests. Furthermore, Feign makes it easy to unit test your conversions knowing this.
